        <h2>About MyGeneRank</h2>
        <p>Many conditions affecting our health are caused by a combination of our environment, our behaviors, and our genes. While we can alter some factors in our lives to reduce our chances of developing different diseases (e.g., not smoking cigarettes), the contribution from our genetic risk encoded by our DNA remains with us throughout our lives. Scientists are still trying to determine the entirety of genetic factors that influence disease, but for some conditions it has been shown that the factors identified thus far can begin to identify people at high to low genetic risk. Looking across your genome, we can calculate your cumulative genetic risk score â€“ which can be used to rank your genetic risk compared to the other worldwide populations.</p>
